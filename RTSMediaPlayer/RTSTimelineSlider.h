/**
 *  A slider displaying events along its track as small icons. The slider can be tapped at any point to jump at the 
 *  corresponding location.
 *
 *  The slider is meant to be associated with a timeline, which it displays events from. As the timeline is scrolled,
 *  icons matching visible cells in the timeline are automatically highlighted.
 *
 *  To add a slider to a custom player layout, simply drag and drop an RTSTimelineSlider onto the player layout,
 *  and bind its timelineView outlet to an associated timeline. You can of course also instantiate the view 
 *  programmatically.
