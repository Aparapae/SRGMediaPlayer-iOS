 *  A view displaying segments associated with a stream as a linear collection of cells
 *
 *  To add a timeline to a custom player layout, simply drag and drop an RTSTimelineView onto the player layout,
 *  and bind its mediaPlayerController, dataSource and delegate outlets.
 *
 *  Customisation of timeline cells is achieved through subclassing of UICollectionViewCell, exactly like a usual 
 *  UICollectionView. Segments are represented by the RTSMediaPlayerSegment class, which only carry a few pieces of
 *  information. If you need more information to be displayed on a cell (e.g. a title or a thumbnail), subclass 
 *  RTSMediaPlayerSegment to add the data you need, and use this information when returning cells from your data source.
