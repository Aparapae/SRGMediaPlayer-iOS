/**
 *  A view displaying events associated with a stream as a linear collection of cells
 *
 *  To add a timeline to a custom player layout, simply drag and drop an RTSTimelineView onto the player layout,
 *  and bind its mediaPlayerController, dataSource and delegate outlets. Then implement the RTSTimelineViewDataSource
 *  and RTSTimelineViewDelegate protocols to supply the information required by the timeline. You can of course
 *  also instantiate the view programmatically.
 *
 *  The timeline itself does not implement any event retrieval mechanism. The responsibility of retrieving events
 *  is namely usually the responsibility of a parent view controller. For periodic update of the timeline, the
 *  RTSMediaPlayerController class offers an -addPlaybackTimeObserverForInterval:queue:usingBlock: method you
 *  can use. Refer to its documentation for more information.
 *
 *  Customisation of timeline cells is achieved through subclassing of UICollectionViewCell, exactly like a usual 
 *  UICollectionView. Events are represented by the RTSTimelineEvent class, which only carry a few pieces of
 *  information. If you need more information to be displayed on a cell (e.g. a title or a thumbnail), subclass 
 *  RTSTimelineEvent to add the data you need, and use this information when returning cells from your data source.
 *
 *  A special kind of slider can be bound to a timeline view, see RTSTimelineSlider for more information
