/**
 *  Call a block during playback of an associated player. A playback time observer is similar to a periodic time 
 *  observer, but its periodic execution is reliable. A periodic time observer namely executes the associated block 
 *  not only during playback at regular time intervals, but also when the player status changes. This leads to more 
 *  calls than expected when a task must be performed in a reliable regular fashion. Playback time observers are
 *  especially useful when regularly retrieving metadata from a webservice during playback, for example.
 *
 *  Since a playback time observer calls the associated block only when the associated player is actually playing,
 *  stream information (e.g. duration, current time) is available and reliable when implementing the block. A 
 *  playback time observer can therefore also be used to update information only available during playback
 *  (e.g. stream position, remaining time).
