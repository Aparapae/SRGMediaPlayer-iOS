/**
 *  `SRGMediaPlayerController` is inspired by the `MPMoviePlayerController` class. It manages the playback of a media 
 *  from a file or a network stream, but provides only core player functionality. As such, it is intended for custom
 *  media player implementation. If you need a player with limited customization abilities but which you can readily 
 *  use, you should have a look at `SRGMediaPlayerViewController` instead.
 *
 *  ## Functionalities
 *
 * `SRGMediaPlayerController` provides standard player features:
 *    - Media playback (audios and videos)
 *    - Playback status information (mostly through notifications or KVO)
 *    - Media information (stream and media type)
 *
 *  In addition, `SRGMediaPlayerController` optionally supports segments. A segment is part of a media, defined by a
 *  start time and a duration. Segments make it possible to add a logical structure on top of a media, e.g. topics
 *  in a news show, chapters in a movie, and so on. If segments are associated with the media being played, 
 *  `SRGMediaPlayerController` will:
 *    - Report transitions between segments when they occur (through notifications)
 *    - Skip segments which must must not be played (blocked segments)
 *
 *  ## Basic usage
 *
 *  `SRGMediaPlayerController` is a raw media player and is usually not used as is (though it could, for example
 *  when you only need to play audio files).
 *
 *  To implement your own custom media player, you need create your own player class (most probably a view controller),
 *  and to delegate playback to an `SRGMediaPlayerController` instance:
 *    - Instantiate `SRGMediaPlayerController` in your player implementation file. If you are using a storyboard or 
 *      a xib to define your player layout, you can also drop a plain object with Interface Builder and assign it the
 *      `SRGMediaPlayerController` class. Be sure to connect an outlet to it if you need to later refer to it from
 *      witin your code
 *    - When creating a video player, you must add the `view` property somewhere within your view hierarchy so that
 *      the content can be properly displayed:
 *        - If you are instantiating the controller in a storyboard or a nib, this is easily achieved by adding a view 
 *          with the `SRGMediaPlayerView` to your layout, and binding it to the `view` property right from Interface 
 *          Builder.
 *        - If you have instantiated `SRGMediaPlayerController` in code, then you must add the `view` property manually
 *          to your view hierarchy by calling `-[UIView addSubview:]` or one of the similar `UIView` methods. Be sure 
 *          to set constraints or autoresizing masks properly so that the view behaves as expected.
 *      If you only need to implement an audio player, you can skip this step.
 *    - Call one of the play methods to start playing your media
 *
 *  You should now have a working implementation able to play audios or videos. There is no way to pause playback or to 
 *  seek within the media, though. The `SRGMediaPlayer` library provides a few standard controls and overlays with which 
 *  you can easily add such functionalities to your custom player.
 *
 *  ## Controls and overlays
 *
 *
 *  For maximum flexibility, you can incorporate a media playerâ€™s view into a view hierarchy owned by your app and have
 *  it managed by an `SRGMediaPlayerController` instance. If you just need a standard player with a view looking just
 *  like the standard iOS media player, you should simply instantiate an `SRGMediaPlayerViewController` which will manage
 *  the view for you.
 *
 *  The media player controller posts several notifications, see SRGMediaPlayerConstants.h
 *
 *  Errors are handled through the `SRGMediaPlayerPlaybackDidFailNotification` notification. There are two possible
 *  source of errors: either the error comes from the dataSource (see `RTSMediaPlayerControllerDataSource`) or from
 *  the network (playback error).
 *
 *  The media player controller manages its overlays visibility. See the `overlayViews` property.
 *
 *  Methods related to playback can be found in the `RTSMediaPlayback` protocol
